Examining the serological response to SARS-CoV-2 infection and vaccination across the National Core Studies

When we catch COVID-19, or have a vaccination for COVID-19, our bodies make special substances called antibodies to tackle the virus. However, some people make fewer antibodies than others, or their antibodies disappear quicker over time. These people have less protection from COVID-19, so might benefit from a booster vaccine.
This project aims to identify groups of people who have fewer antibodies after having the COVID-19 infection, or after having the vaccine. Examples of these groups might be older people, or people who had other health problems before getting Covid. To do this, we need to link data from our research studies to NHS health record data, such as data on whether people have had COVID-19 and whether they have had a COVID-19 vaccine. We also need to know exactly when they were infected or vaccinated, so we can work out how their levels of antibodies have changed from that time onwards.
We will share the results of this project with policy makers and hope that it will inform decisions about who should be put first in the list for future COVID-19 booster vaccinations.
